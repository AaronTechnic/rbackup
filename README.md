# How to run the script?

This script can only be run on Linux and macOS computers at the time. A Windows version of this script will come soon.

So, lets make the script exectutable. This can be done on Linux and macOS computers.

Open up a terminal and type:

chmod +x /Path/to/backup-all-your-files.sh (make sure to replace /Path/to with your desired username and file system)

Now, lets run the script (make sure you have edited it)

Type in the terminal:

/Path/to/backup-all-your-files.sh (again, make sure to replace /Path/to with your desired username and file system)

And........viola! Your backup will be in the external drive.
